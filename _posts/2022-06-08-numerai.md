Whew, I haven't posted in a long time! I've been very busy with my full time role, but recently, I have been making time to further develop some of my side projects. I hope that this article serves newcomers to data science as well as advanced practitioners in one way or another. With this post, I'll aim to cover a number of different topic pertaining this interesting competition. I'll break down the concept of what the numer.ai tournament is all about, explain some of the challenges behind what makes it such a hard problem to do well with, and most importantly I'll introduce a key workflow for automating the process of making submissions for the competition. I really hope that this helps some folks get started in data science and predictive modeling, whether they end up using IBM Cloud to automate or not is a matter of preference. So let's get into the problem!

## Understanding the Problem
[Numerai](numer.ai) is an ongoing weekly competition which is open to anyone who is willing to try it. Essentially, this tournament is designed to help in the management of a real-life hedge fund. The hedge fund behind numerai aims to be "The last hedge fund in the world", and it is aiming to achieve this by completely out-sourcing its quantitative analysis to a community of data science practitioners. In a traditional hedge fund, quantitative analysts use sensitive financial data to create signals and indicators for the movement of stock prices. In numerai, we are tasked with the incredible task of achieving this same outcome... with completely masked data.

The data is completely obfuscated which means that we have no way of deciphering what the underlying asset is, nor what the features are truly representing. The competition is designed like this on purpose; because we are working to predict real values in the market, we need real data. The only way to get real financial data is through some expensive arrangements, but the founders have established a safe method for providing this same information without exposing sensitive information. So with masked data to work with, we are really reduced to machine learning and data science practices to help us not only create results, but improve upon them and refine them. I can't stress enough how awesome the numer.ai community is in helping each other learn and grow. As you get started with the competition, make sure you create an account and introduce yourself to the community of practitioners through their forum.

From the main page of [numer.ai](numer.ai) you can download an excellent starting folder which will provide you with all of the assets you will need to give a first pass. Follow the directions from their documentation and you will have a submission for the most recent week ready in no time! The process of creating predictions and submitting them to numerai can be a cumbersome process to manually do on a weekly basis, so luckily, numer.ai has provided a walkthrough as to how to automate this process with AWS and CLI tools. Now, this is a great solution for automation and I want to really thank the community for providing this guidance. On my end, I wanted to achieve this same automation, but being that I'm well versed in the world of IBM software and technology, I had to take a step back and see what I could do to achieve this same level of automation with a different software platform. I've succeeded in just that; [the numer.ai competition is now fully automated through IBM Cloud!](https://github.com/DAVIDCRUZ0202/numerai_automation)


## Conclusion
This blog post barely scratches the surface for everything that has to do with the numer.ai competition. As far as the data goes, we can go into deep-dive discussions about the structure of the data, the relationships that we can uncover, and how we can get into some more advanced feature engineering with what we have to work with. With modeling, we could explore a wide variety of machine learning models that can be fit to predict this data, and why some models are better than others. Again, I highly recommend researching through the forums of numer.ai to learn and contribute your ideas. As far as automation goes, click on the link to my github repository above and read the readme for directions on how to achieve hands-off participation via IBM Cloud.
